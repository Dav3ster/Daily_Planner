# Daily-Planner

## Purpose of this challenge
The Purpose of this challenege was to reinforce Jquery practices in a dynamic setting. I also got to see how useful bootstrap can be, along with other web apis. This challenge was a great example of how less can be more when the right tools are applied. After completing this challenge, I have gained more experience in moving data to and from local storage, along with more JavaScript practice using conditional statements and functions.
